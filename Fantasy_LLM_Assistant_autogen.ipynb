      "Post Title: 'Predicting the Best Sleeper RB for the 4th Straight Year'\n",
      "                    User: MoistyMcMoisterton\n",
      "                    Subreddit: r/fantasyfootball:\n",
      "                    Text body: **TL;DR**: Najee Harris is the running back to target, with Josh Jacobs as a very close second. Before you roll your eyes, I’ve got the evidence to back it up! (Note: This was mostly written before Jaylen Warren’s hamstring issues and AJ Dillon’s IR designation, but those changes don’t significantly alter my take.) Oh and for the record I like Jacobs more than Najee but in the spirit of a true sleeper, we'll roll with Harris.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Secondary TL;DR**: The main message here is to prioritize wide receivers early because there’s a lot of depth in running back talent this year (contrary to popular opinion). While I’m focused on Najee/Jacobs, I also highlight a few other late-round gems.\n",
      "\n",
      "To anyone who’s followed my advice over the past three years, there’s a good chance you’ve won your league—so congrats! This strategy has consistently identified the biggest sleeper running back each season.\n",
      "\n",
      "By applying a simple philosophy, I predicted the breakout campaigns of [James Conner](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/s/6ZuubJ6sPx), [Josh Jacobs](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/s/giMAYbtsfJ), and [Breece Hall](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/s/YkbhOhoCxZ). Sometimes, the logic doesn’t lead to an exact match, but there are always players who come close. This year, there’s one guy I’m drafting in every league: Najee Harris. Here’s why you should consider reaching for him as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The formula is simple: Most top running backs are relatively similar in talent, and if we graded them on ability alone, there would be about 20 in Tier 1 for fantasy purposes (or maybe Tier 2, behind CMC). Najee Harris has proven he’s got the talent, both as a runner and a receiver. He’s never rushed for less than 1,000 yards and has as much pass-catching upside as anyone. So, it’s all about the situation and opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What pieces have improved?**\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, while opinions vary on Russell Wilson’s decline, most would agree that he’s better than Kenny Pickett. Last year, Pickett ranked 30th in accuracy, while Russ was 9th. Denver was a disaster, but the idea of Russ in a Mike Tomlin-led offense is intriguing (we’ll get to the dreaded offensive coordinator in a moment). I’m almost convinced to fade QB early and take Russ as a late-round option, given his rushing floor and improved weapons. If you’re stuck late in a draft with subpar QBs, he’s worth a look.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, the Steelers have spent the offseason improving their atrocious offensive line. Three of the five linemen are rookies or second-year players. It might take a few weeks for them to gel, but a revamped O-line is a boon for a between-the-tackles runner like Najee. As a former Najee owner, I can attest that even when he was a fantasy darling, the O-line was dreadful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, no more Matt Canada. Post-Canada, Najee finished as RB13 in PPR and RB8 in standard formats. Sure, there were a few dud weeks, but what do you expect in a transition period? Steelers fans might chime in, but it seems like they experimented with Warren in a couple of games before Najee finished the season with a monstrous 19-27-31 touches in the final three weeks, leading to a playoff berth. During that stretch, he was RB3 in all formats.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Addressing the Elephant in the Room: Arthur Smith**\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I’m aware that Arthur “Enemy of Fantasy Football” Smith doesn’t care about your fantasy team. But keep in mind that Smith was with the Titans from 2011-2020, working his way up to offensive coordinator before taking the Falcons’ head coaching job (which he promptly tanked). This tenure included two Derrick Henry rushing titles and a top-three year from DeMarco Murray. (I might be overanalyzing, but just hearing “Arthur Smith” makes me nervous, so I needed some reassurance.)\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, Najee fits the mold of a large, hard-hitting, aggressive Arthur Smith-style running back. While Derrick Henry-level production might be wishful thinking, Smith knows what it takes to put a player like Najee in the driver’s seat. Plus, I don’t think Mike Tomlin will tolerate any of the chaotic decision-making that Smith allowed in Atlanta. This might be wishful thinking, or it could be that Pittsburgh’s front office—second-best record this century (thanks Tom) — sees value where we fantasy players don’t.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Best Part?**\n",
      "\n",
      "With an ADP in the high 70s, you can fill out your entire roster before grabbing Najee as a flex or even a bench player. Oh, and did I mention it’s a contract year? Expect the Steelers to run him into the ground while Najee plays with something to prove.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Clearing Up a Major Misconception**\n",
      "\n",
      "“But what about Jaylen Warren?” I hear you ask. While it’s tempting to believe that the lesser-known back will take over the role from the higher-profile, more physical player, history suggests otherwise. Remember the concern about Zamir White during Jacobs’ breakout year? Or the hype around Chase Edmonds before James Conner emerged in Arizona? I just don’t see Warren becoming an every-down guy with his physical attributes and conveniently, neither does Vegas!\n",
      "\n",
      "Vegas odds put Najee at 14th most likely to win the rushing title, with similar odds to players like Gibbs and Montgomery. Players with lower odds include Zamir White, Joe Mixon, James Conner, Rachaad White, Rhamondre Stevenson, Aaron Jones, Alvin Kamara, and D’Andre Swift. Warren’s odds are +9500 compared to Najee’s +3000. Vegas is three times more confident in Najee, which means if you’re still not sold on Najee, you should probably avoid this backfield altogether. Warren will be nothing more than a constant tease in my book.\n",
      "\n",
      "To me, going down the depth chart is overthinking it. I’ll always choose the proven starter unless they’re aged out of their prime or have shown significant regression. In this offense, there’s only one running back worth drafting—Najee. A hill I’m willing to die on is that Warren’s ceiling is to ruin value for both backs, and he won’t have standalone fantasy value unless there’s an injury.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Can’t Buy into Najee? Here’s Who Else Offers Late-Round Value**\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re not sold on Najee, here are a few honorable mentions. These players either loosely fit the formula or require more draft capital than Najee.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of my favorites is **Josh Jacobs**. Honestly, I might like him more than Najee, and I’m reaching for him every chance I get. But I hesitate to classify him as a sleeper since he’s going in the 30s. The Packers showed promise late last year, and Jacobs has zero competition on the depth chart. He’ll get plenty of work on the ground and through the air. Don’t be surprised if he finishes as a top-five PPR back. I’m a little disappointed that AJ Dillon got hurt because he was a non-factor anyway, and his injury only pushes Jacobs up the ranks.\n",
      "\n",
      "**D’Andre Swift** leaves a talented Philly team that underutilized his pass-catching abilities (Ibleed green but they consistently botch the running back role). Swift now finds himself on a Bears team loaded with talent. Drafting him as an RB2 could be a luxury. When searching for an RB, finding a guy who will get plenty of goal-line carries is crucial, and Swift fits that role. Not to mention he's likely to play the safety blanket role for their shiny new rookie QB. Plus, you could draft him as a flex.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another intriguing option is **James Conner**, especially if you believe in Harrison’s potential. Getting Kyler Murray back will help keep the offense moving. Conner was solid last year, and a better team means even more opportunities. If you’re not deep at RB, handcuffing him makes sense too. Again, a player who could be drafted as a flex.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Joe Mixon**, playing on a Texans team with a non-running QB, should have plenty of goal-line opportunities and be a workhorse. My hesitation is that while the Texans were exciting, they weren’t statistically as good as they looked, and Mixon hasn’t been the most efficient back. I’m leaning toward fading the team, but I don’t hate the Mixon play either. He could add surprising value.\n",
      "\n",
      "Top names like Saquon Barkley, Bijan Robinson, and Breece Hall will find themselves in better situations, but they don’t qualify as sleepers—just something to consider. I’m confident in the late-round options mentioned above, so I don’t mind reaching for them while grabbing stud WRs early. It’s going to be a deep year for RBs, in my opinion.\n",
