The bye comes at a good time for the Eagles who could use some time to get healthy and regroup. Seattle’s rookie tight end, **AJ Barner**enjoyed Geno Smith’s career best game stat-wise as the Seahawks tried to mount a comeback against the Lions. Noah Fant is losing work to Pharoah Brown and the rookie. Probably not a trustworthy start but this is the first I have heard of Barner and he may be a name to remember. \n",
